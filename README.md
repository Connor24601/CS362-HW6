# CS362: Homework 6 #

'assemble' is an implementation of a simple De Bruijn assembler that takes
reads as input and outputs the assembled contigs of those reads. 
'simulate' takes known contigs and generates a set of reads with user-selected
coverage, read length and error rate.

## Dependencies ## 

<a href = "http://www.graphviz.org/download/">GraphViz</a> for DOT (used only for generating intermediate graphs during assembly, should be optional some day).
